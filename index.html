  <p> Masville National High School, located in Para√±aque City, has expanded its offerings and now includes Senior High School with three strands: Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMASS), Accountancy Business Management (ABM), and Technical-Vocational Learning (TVL). Established as an annex of Dr. Arcadio Santos National High School in 1994, the school's Masville building was completed in 1996 with support from local officials. It gained independence in 2007 and was officially named Masville National High School in 2008. The school has experienced various principal changes and remains committed to evolving and adapting to the evolving educational environment, including providing online learning during the pandemic.</p>
